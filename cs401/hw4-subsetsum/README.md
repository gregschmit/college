HW4 - Subset Sum Problem  

## About

This is an implementation of a subset sum algorithm.

## Usage

`ssum <N_MAX> <TARGET> < <INPUT_FILE>`

Where:

 - N_MAX is the upper bound on the number of elements in the set (problem size).
 - TARGET is the target sum that we are looking for in the subsets.
 - INPUT_FILE is the file that contains the set.

## Compilation

Compile using `Clang` or `gcc`. On Unix systems such as FreeBSD, the easiest way is:

`make ssum`
