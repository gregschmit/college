## Questions

1. I predicted the general pattern of the output, but some stuff was out of order due to how long the system takes to end a process and other behavior that is pseudo-random. This would increase the amount of time the process is spending time on signal handling.
2. The result is not exactly repeatable for the reasons I gave above.

7. The non-static version had to make system calls to shared object libraries.

I got to step 8 in the lab.
