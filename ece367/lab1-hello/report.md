# Lab 1 (Hello, world) - Group 4

## Summary

We modified the provided `main.c` to implement three features:

 - Modification of initial message
 - Modification of the function of `SW1` to change the frequency of the blinking
 - Modification of the function of `SW2` to change the color of the LED

## Questions

 1. We used two global variables for the frequency and color. We then had the LED event use those values to determine the color and frequency (time of next scheduled call). We then modified the switch events to change the global variables.
 2. The program used 12KB of Flash memory and 1.3KB of SRAM.
