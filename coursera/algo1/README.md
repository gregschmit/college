This is the project directory for all my homework for Princeton's Coursera Algorithms (Part 1) course.

I noticed the first two assignments both needed the `algs4.jar`, and to make my dev env simpler I decided to just unpack that into this directory so any homework `.java` files have access without having to modify classpath.
