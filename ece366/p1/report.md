## Introduction

The goal of the g3l instruction set architecture (ISA) is to provide a simple application programming interface (API) to execute a single program that finds the largest number (and index of) in a given array in memory, and finds the remainder of a division operation (again, stored in memory).

The primary goal was to reduce the amount of instructions provided by the ISA.

## Format of Memory and Instructions

Registers and memory are tribble-addressable. The bus for instructions is 8-bits long, however only 5-bits are relevant.

.data starts at `0b00000000` and .text starts at `0b10000000`. Memory is only 256 tribbles total.

## Registers (8 total 12-bit registers)

There are eight 12-bit (tribble) registers.

- r0 - zero
- r1 - 3rd large stack
- r2 - 3rd large stack
- r3 - 3rd large stack
- r4 - 3rd large stack entry
- r5 - for loop counter
- r6 - mem ptr
- r7 - mem target

## Answers to Questions

1. How large is the main memory?
  - Since everyting is tribble-addressable, there is a theoretical limit to 4096 tribbles. However, the hadware only implements 256 tribbles, 128 of which are `.data` and 128 of which are `.text`.
2. In what ways did you optimize for dynamic instruction count (goal 1)
  - I implemented a partial-bubble-sort algorithm which provides linear complexity (like the naive 3-loop search method), but drastically reduces the complexity constant since after you find on of the largest three values, fewer computations are required on the rest of the data.
3. In what ways did you optimize for ease of design (goal 2)?
  - I focused on reducing the quantity of instructions that are available, and as a result, all of the instructions are restricted to specific values. This ensures that the hardware design will be simple, even if it requires some hardcoding of constant values.
4. If you optimized for anything else, what and how?
  - I got my instruction size down to 5-bit. This was a bit of [code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com).
5. Your chief competitor just announced a load-store ISA with two explicit operands (one source register is also used as destination), four registers (i.e., a 2-bit register specifiers), and 16 instructions (4 opcode bits). Explain why your ISA is better.
  - My ISA is simpler and uses less memory for a program, since the instructions are all 5-bit. Also, my ISA optimizes a partial bubble sort algorithm, which the competitors does not.
6. What do you think will be the bottleneck in your design? That is, what donâ€™t you have that you will miss the most if you were to have to write other longer programs?
  - g3l optimizes a single program (really, two programs), but writing other programs would be painful, since the instructions are not general at all.
7. What would you have done differently if you had 2 more bits for instructions?
  - None, since I optimized my instructions to make them shorter.
8. 2 fewer bits?
  - None, since 6-bits is still longer than my instruction set.
